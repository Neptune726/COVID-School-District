# COVID-School-District
Under the shadow of the current COVID-19 pandemic, schools are confronted with a
dilemma, should classes continue to be taught in person, or should schools be closed and
classes moved online? This dilemma has agonized school district officials, parents, and
students since the start of the pandemic. As CDC Principal Deputy Director, Dr Anne
Schuchat, noted during a U.S. Senate Committee hearing, ”You have this balance between
the earlier you act, the more impact it can have in slowing the spread, and the enormous
disruption we see with school closures.”

This study is conducted to investigate whether K-12 schools teaching students online
can significantly reduce COVID-19 transmission by comparing the R0, the basic reproduction number, in communities with different in-person-teaching ratios in their K-12
schools.
